## ✅ Features

**1. 🔒 Kernel-Level Access for Maximum Compatibility**  
Built with a custom driver that operates at the kernel level, allowing the trainer to interact directly with game processes without restrictions. This ensures compatibility even with protected or hard-to-access games.

**2. ⚡ Dynamic Code Injection**  
Automatically injects code into memory bytes, eliminating the need for static pointer addresses. The trainer dynamically acquires updated addresses every time the game updates.

**3. 🎛️ Customizable Hotkey Combinations _(Enabled solely for individually licensed products.)_**  
Use any combination of hotkeys without limitations, including complex combinations of more than four keys.

**4. 🛠️ Flexible Memory Management _(Enabled solely for individually licensed products.)_**  
Configure the trainer to NOP memory bytes or inject code dynamically to obtain addresses. Fully customize hotkeys for any address to match your preferences.

**5. 🗺️ Comprehensive Teleport Menu**  
Save and load player positions with unlimited slots, and manage saved locations through transferable and editable text files.

**6. 🔍 Dynamic Hotkey Display _(Enabled solely for individually licensed products.)_**  
Automatically displays your hotkeys and address descriptions directly in the GUI, adapting seamlessly to any game you choose.

**7. 🔄 Flexible Hotkey Modes _(Enabled solely for individually licensed products.)_**  
Set hotkeys to hold or toggle, choose the address value type, and fine-tune according to your needs.

**8. 🖥️ Process Name Configuration**  
Specify the process name in a text file for seamless use with the trainer.

**9. 🔗 Automatic Address Updates**  
Byte addresses in the configuration file are updated automatically when the game updates, removing the need for manual edits — unless the bytes themselves change.
