# Introducing the Ultimate Game Trainer  
A versatile and high-performance tool for game hacking.

## Features

1. **Kernel-Level Access for Maximum Compatibility**  
   Built with a custom driver that operates at the kernel level, allowing the trainer to interact directly with game processes without restrictions. This ensures compatibility even with protected or hard-to-access games.  

2. **Dynamic Code Injection**  
   Automatically injects code into memory bytes, eliminating the need for static pointer addresses. The trainer dynamically acquires updated addresses every time the game updates.  

3. **Customizable Hotkey Combinations (_Enabled solely for individually licensed products._)**  
   Use any combination of hotkeys without limitations, including complex combinations of more than four keys.  

4. **Flexible Memory Management (_Enabled solely for individually licensed products._)**  
   Configure the trainer to NOP memory bytes or inject code dynamically to obtain addresses. Fully customize hotkeys for any address to match your preferences.  

5. **Comprehensive Teleport Menu**  
   Save and load player positions with unlimited slots, and manage saved locations through transferable and editable text files.  

6. **Dynamic Hotkey Display (_Enabled solely for individually licensed products._)**  
   Automatically displays your hotkeys and address descriptions directly in the GUI, adapting seamlessly to any game you choose.  

7. **Flexible Hotkey Modes (_Enabled solely for individually licensed products._)**  
   Set hotkeys to hold or toggle, choose the address value type, and fine-tune according to your needs.  

8. **Process Name Configuration**  
   Specify the process name in a text file for seamless use with the trainer.  

9. **Automatic Address Updates**  
   Byte addresses in the configuration file are updated automatically when the game updates, removing the need for manual edits — unless the bytes themselves change.
